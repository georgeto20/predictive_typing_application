This repo contains the code for the predictive typing application which served as my final project for the NLP course that I took at NYU during Fall 2018.

To find out more about the project, click [here](gt941_Final%20Project%20Final%20Draft.pdf).

To run the project, pass two arguments to the program: en_US.news.txt (the training file), and either en_US.blogs.txt (the development file) or en_US.twitter.txt (the test file). Note that it takes several minutes to run, as each file is quite large.
